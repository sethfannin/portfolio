# ATS PRD â€“ Salesforce Internal Tools

This project outlines a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an internal Applicant Tracking System (ATS) built in Salesforce. The document showcases how I would architect the system across user roles, flows, and AI-driven automationsâ€”based on my experience supporting secure Salesforce environments like Leidos.

ðŸ“„ **Included:**
- [ATS_PRD_Salesforce.pdf](ATS_PRD_Salesforce.pdf) â€“ Full document outlining:
  - Custom objects for hiring lifecycle
  - Record types, approval flows, access control
  - Recruiter/user UX enhancements
  - AI features: resume parsing, skill tagging, auto-matching
  - Dashboards & compliance insights

ðŸ§  **Role Fit:**
This project reflects my ability to straddle rolesâ€”Salesforce Dev, Product Ops, and internal tools strategistâ€”while aligning tech delivery with mission needs in regulated environments.
