## 🧭 Overview  
This case study reimagines the VA’s prescription refill and tool onboarding experience through a mobile-first, accessible, and trust-building redesign. The goal was to simplify multi-step workflows for Veterans while aligning with compliance, accessibility, and human-centered best practices.

## ❗️Problem  

**Prescription Refill Flow:**  
- Veterans face friction in online prescription refill workflows.  
- Legacy designs lacked clarity in copy, task hierarchy, and accessibility.  
- Users reported frustration, uncertainty, and drop-offs during the process.  

**COTS Tool Onboarding:**  
- Access request processes were fragmented, slow, and emotionally draining.  
- No centralized catalog, lack of transparency, and unclear approvals.  
- Led to delayed productivity and increased user frustration.

---

## 💡 Solution  

- Created a **single-page interactive prototype** with streamlined task flow for prescription refill.  
- Developed a **companion journey map** visualizing the onboarding pain points and ideal experience.  
- Applied service design and WCAG/508 accessibility principles.  
- Used design intelligence tools (AI + UX heuristics) to improve confidence and efficiency.

---

## 🎯 UX Goals  
- Simplify complex VA workflows into user-centered, accessible flows.  
- Improve task completion rates with clearer copy and visual hierarchy.  
- Reduce friction, error, and emotional stress across stages.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods  
- **Webflow (AI Builder):** for rapid prototyping & publishing.  
- **LaTeX / TikZ:** for data visualization & PDF documentation.  
- **WCAG/508 Compliance Patterns:** accessibility-first principles.  
- **Netlify:** mobile-first HTML demo hosting.  
- **AI (Gemini, Claude, GPT):** assisted with ideation, diagramming, and structure.

## 📈 Outcome  

- 🔗 **[Interactive Demo](https://va-ux-demo.netlify.app)** — mobile-first prototype simulating the ideal prescription refill workflow.  
- 📄 **[Download Journey Map (PDF)](./VA_Onboarding_Journey_Map.pdf)** — visual storytelling of emotional arc and user experience gaps during COTS tool onboarding.

Together, these artifacts show how small UX and system design shifts can unlock clarity, trust, and speed — even in legacy, compliance-heavy environments.
