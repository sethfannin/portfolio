	•	Legacy designs lacked clarity in copy, task hierarchy, and accessibility.
	•	Users reported frustration, uncertainty, and drop-offs during the process.

⸻

💡 Solution
	•	Created a single-page interactive prototype with streamlined task flow.
	•	Applied service design principles to reduce errors and increase confidence.
	•	Incorporated 508-compliant accessibility standards and plain-language copy.

⸻

🎯 UX Goals
	•	Simplify the refill workflow into a clear, confidence-building flow.
	•	Improve task completion rates with better copy and visual hierarchy.
	•	Reduce frustration & error through accessible and compliant design.

⸻

⚙️ Tools & Methods
