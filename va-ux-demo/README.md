**Live Demo:** [va-ux-demo.netlify.app](https://va-ux-demo.netlify.app)


### 📌 Overview

This case study reimagines the VA’s prescription refill experience through a mobile-first, accessible, and trust-building redesign.
The goal was to simplify a multi-step process for veterans while aligning with compliance, accessibility, and user-centered best practices.



### ❓ Problem
	•	Veterans face friction and confusion in online prescription refill workflows.
	•	Legacy designs lacked clarity in copy, task hierarchy, and accessibility.
	•	Users reported frustration, uncertainty, and drop-offs during the process.



### 💡 Solution
	•	Created a single-page interactive prototype with streamlined task flow.
	•	Applied service design principles to reduce errors and increase confidence.
	•	Incorporated 508-compliant accessibility standards and plain-language copy.



### 🎯 UX Goals
	•	Simplify the refill workflow into a clear, confidence-building flow.
	•	Improve task completion rates with better copy and visual hierarchy.
	•	Reduce frustration & error through accessible and compliant design.



### ⚙️ Tools & Methods
	•	Webflow (AI Builder) – rapid prototyping & deployment.
	•	WCAG/508 Compliance Patterns – accessibility-first approach.
	•	Netlify – mobile-first HTML demo hosting.



### 📊 Outcome
	•	Prototype demonstrates how small UX adjustments (copy, hierarchy, accessibility) can significantly improve veteran trust and task completion.
	•	Designed as a blueprint for service design in high-friction, compliance-heavy government systems.
